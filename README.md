So, in this project, the Python Merchant RPG is for how the merchant system do. Its still updated and everyone can commit in this project. This idea come from when my teacher in my class ask to all student to make a system in python, so.. i made this but the first prototype is not like this. Before is more complicated but now i was learn and make my code be better than before.
